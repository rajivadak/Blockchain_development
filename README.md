2. What is a blockchain?
3. Decentralization and distributed systems

- To understand blockchain, an understanding of linked lists is important and also how the pointers work with respect to blockchain entities
- 20 min of studying about understanding the blockchain architecture with respect to linked-lists and pointers, so check the resources for the same in the starred repos
