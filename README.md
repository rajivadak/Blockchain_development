# Blockchain development
---
Progress and goals achieved [w.r.t BlChain_dev]

---

Next action plan:
- Make notes on the below topics and add it to the notes file:
1. What is a blockchain?
2. Pointers and memory management
3. Decentralization and distributed systems
4. W.R.T blockchain making notes on linked-lists and pointers, so check the resources for the same in the starred repos

- decide a small and simple project for initializing of blockchain development
  project 1: Basic Blockchain implementation
  Create a simple blockchain that stores data in blocks. Each block should contain: index,timestamps,data,previous block's hash,current block's hash
  outcome: understand how blocks are linked together using hashes
  tools: use c++ libraries like <openssl/sha.h> for hashing
